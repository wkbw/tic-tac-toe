## Description
The goal of this project is to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game app. The steps to complete this project follow:

## Steps to Create 
* Create game files index.html, winning.js, and colorGame00.jsx
* Generate players
* Change cell colors and track state
* Pass state from parent to child
* Mount and unmount
* Track useEffect and game state

## How to Run
* To run, open ___index.html___.
* First player, 'X', clicks a square
* Second player, 'O', clicks a square
* Alternate turns until a player wins or game end in a tie


## Roadmap of Future Improvements

* If the game ends in a tie, aka cat's game:
  - Push a tied game notification
  - Throw in a cat graphic
  - Ask if players want to play again. If yes, restart game; if no, close the window.
* If the game ends with a player winning:
  - All square become static so play ends
  - Jazz up the "Winning Player" text so it's eye-catching, or
  - Push a "Player ${player} Wins" notification
  - Ask if players want to play again. If yes, restart the game; if no, close the window.

## Learning Insights

Continued practice with useState, setState, and custom hooks
